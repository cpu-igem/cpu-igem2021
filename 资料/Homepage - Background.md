# Background

With the rapid development of e-commerce, the number of express delivery is increasing year by year. In 2020, China's express delivery volume will reach 70 billion pieces. In order to ensure the integrity and safety of goods in express transportation, express enterprises often need to package goods. When the package arrives in the hands of consumers, packaging materials turn into packaging waste.

Among them, PE plastic is the most widely used in express packaging, and PE production accounts for about 1 / 4 of the total plastic production. However, the way of PE plastic recycling is not ideal, which will bring us serious excessive loss of resources and environmental pollution.
